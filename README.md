# Conversational IR

## Relevant datasets and benchmarks

- [QuAC](http://quac.ai/): Question Answering in Context
  - "A dataset for modeling, understanding, and participating in **information seeking dialog**. Data instances consist of an interactive dialog between two crowd workers: (1) a student who poses a sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short excerpts (spans) from the text."
  
- [CoQA](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/): A Conversational Question Answering Challenge
  - "CoQA contains 127,000+ questions with answers collected from **8000+ conversations**. Each conversation is collected by pairing two crowdworkers to chat about a passage in the form of questions and answers."
